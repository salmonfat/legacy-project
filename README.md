This project is letting people set a legacy contract to prevent losing asset if the owner pass away before telling inheritor his/her wallet private key.
The legacy can also be setted as installment to prevent inheritor spending the money in short time.



1. Assign am inheritor and legacy amount, how many periods for installment, how long between each period, and set the timer.
2. If the owner can not reset the timer in time, the contract will default the owner passed away, and let inheritor claim the money.
3. The timer will be now + X days. (example: today is 13 Feb 2022, I input 365 to set the timer. So I must reset the timer before 13 Feb 2023, otherwise the contract will default me dead.)
4. If owner wants to withdraw money can put withdraw button.
5. If the owner passed away, inheritor can put claim to claim the money.
